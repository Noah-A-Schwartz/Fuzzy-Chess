TODO: (as of 11/17/2020)

As of now - GUI is 95% complete and AI is needed to be worked on

Game Logic - 
As far as I know - everything works and there are no bugs
  
GUI -
Still need to update rules page and add more themes to game
AI timer runs smoothly and not too fast and waits for roll
animation to continue its move list(I personally think)
Possibly add a pvp option/or an ai vs ai option
Animations for attacks are still a possibility
  
  
AI - 
Basic AI completed - just picks random members from those available
to it and then picks a random location from the generated moves/captures
Need to further add complexity to the ai
